Peer rewards system
===================

Something like [bonusly](https://bonus.ly/) where I can recognize that a
work-buddy did something awesome.

Might even be a private cryptocoin. 

What theses points/coins can be spent on is a internal matter for the company
to decide. 

This should have integrations with systems we use like hipchat and github.
